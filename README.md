## Mandelbrot Web

This app is very simple.

It's a Fractal zoomer using URL to map the zoom path of a fractal. It
subdivides the image in 16 parts, and each of them is a hex number in the URL,
representing, the various zooming steps one can take.

The zoom interface is created by links in a image map over the fractal's image.
